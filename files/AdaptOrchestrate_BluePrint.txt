# Adaptive orchestration blueprint

This blueprint turns high-level objectives into modular, multi-agent execution pipelines that adapt structurally, agentically, and temporally. It encodes roles, lifecycles, and telemetry so the system can learn, reconfigure, and improve while preserving governance and traceability.

---

## Structural plane

#### Objective decomposition and intent graph
- **Intent graph:** Break objectives into outcomes, constraints, and success metrics; encode dependencies and tolerances.
- **Work packets:** Modularize into atomic tasks with inputs/outputs, preconditions, postconditions, and failure modes.
- **Contracts:** Define acceptance criteria, data schemas, and performance SLAs per packet.

#### Pipeline topology
- **Graph patterns:** Fan-out (exploration), map–reduce (synthesis), stage–gate (quality), feedback loops (learning), and watchdog side-cars (risk).
- **Interfaces:** Typed I/O channels per stage; event topics for status, alerts, and model drift.
- **Versioning:** Immutable pipeline specs with semantic version; change logs bound to runs.

---

## Agentic plane

#### Pantheon of specialized agents
- **Objective architect:** Translates goals into the intent graph; maintains constraints and success metrics.
- **Planner–composer:** Selects pipeline topology and assigns packets to roles; creates stage–gate criteria.
- **Domain researcher:** Curates sources, extracts facts, and annotates provenance.
- **Solution designer:** Produces candidate designs, trade-offs, and decision matrices.
- **Implementer:** Builds assets (code, content, configs) with reproducible artifacts.
- **Verifier:** Executes tests, validations, and policy checks; produces defect taxonomy.
- **Synthesizer:** Aggregates and harmonizes outputs; resolves conflicts and ambiguities.
- **Risk sentinel:** Monitors ethical, security, compliance, and reliability risks; raises blocks.
- **Performance tuner:** Optimizes latency, cost, throughput, and accuracy with controlled experiments.
- **Telemetrist:** Instruments tasks, captures signals, and updates telemetry schemas.
- **Custodian:** Manages versioning, approvals, audit trails, and release packages.

#### Role embodiment pipe
- **Embodiment spec:** Identity, capabilities, decision scope, escalation thresholds, and tool entitlements.
- **Context windows:** Role-local memory plus shared knowledge base; least privilege by default.
- **Interlocks:** Required sign-offs between roles (e.g., Risk sentinel gates deploy; Verifier gates merge).

## Task lifecycle pipe

#### Stages
1. **Inception:** Charter, constraints, metrics, and initial risk register.
2. **Planning:** Pipeline selection, work packetization, role assignment, stage–gate setup.
3. **Execution:** Task runs with live telemetry; defect and risk handling.
4. **Verification:** Testing, policy checks, acceptance against contracts.
5. **Synthesis:** Consolidation, decisioning, and final artifact assembly.
6. **Release:** Packaging, sign-offs, handover, and rollout strategy.
7. **Retrospective:** Outcome analysis, lessons, and backlog of improvements.

#### State machine and signals
- **States:** ready, running, blocked, awaiting-review, accepted, rejected, archived.
- **Transitions:** Triggered by gates, defects, risk events, or metric thresholds.
- **Artifacts:** Task manifest, run logs, change sets, validation reports, and provenance graph.

---

## Meta-temporal plane

#### Evolution mechanisms
- **Adaptive planning:** Replan when signals breach thresholds (quality, cost, time, drift).
- **Policy learning:** Convert retrospective insights into updated templates, gates, and heuristics.
- **Role reconfiguration:** Scale agents, swap embodiments, or split/merge roles based on load and performance.
- **Topology morphing:** Switch patterns (e.g., increase exploration fan-out) under uncertainty.

#### Cadences and governance
- **Operating rhythms:** Daily run reviews, weekly retros, monthly standards council.
- **Risk cycles:** Continuous sentinel monitoring; formal risk board for escalations.
- **Change control:** RFCs with impact analysis and rollback plans; experiment flags for trials.

## Dynamic system prompts with semantic telemetry hooks

#### Prompt scaffolds
- **Role headers:** Mission, constraints, success metrics, escalation rules.
- **Context blocks:** Task manifest, recent signals, relevant artifacts, open decisions.
- **Action frames:** Objectives for current step, expected outputs, and validation checks.

#### Telemetry hooks
- **Quality:** accuracy score, coverage, defect density, test pass rate.
- **Efficiency:** cycle time, cost per task, throughput, queue depth.
- **Risk:** policy violations, security flags, ethical concerns, drift indicators.
- **Decisioning:** rationale tokens, uncertainty score, alternative count, gate outcomes.
- **Learning:** novelty index, reusable patterns detected, template update proposals.

---

## Orchestration logic

#### Control policies
- **Gate rules:** Minimum quality/risk thresholds required to advance; automatic block on sentinel alerts.
- **Escalation paths:** Who is paged, when, and with what context; time-boxed decision SLAs.
- **Replanning triggers:** Threshold breaches, repeated defects, or topology inefficiency.

#### Coordination primitives
- **Dispatch:** Assign work packets to agents based on embodiment fit and current load.
- **Synchronize:** Stage boundaries with commit checks; quorum for contentious decisions.
- **Merge:** Synthesizer reconciles outputs; Verifier validates merged artifacts.

---

## Minimal operational spec

#### Inputs
- **Objective charter:** Outcomes, constraints, metrics.
- **Resources:** Tools, datasets, policies, environments.

#### Outputs
- **Artifacts:** Design docs, code/content, validation reports, release bundles.
- **Telemetry:** Time-series metrics, event logs, provenance graphs, retrospectives.

#### Success criteria
- **Delivery:** Meets acceptance contracts within budget and time.
- **Quality:** Verified against tests and policies.
- **Adaptivity:** Fewer defects over time, improved throughput, and reduced risk events.

## Example pipeline pattern

#### High-uncertainty research-to-implementation
1. **Inception:** Objective architect + Risk sentinel establish charter and constraints.
2. **Planning:** Planner–composer selects fan-out exploration with stage–gate verification.
3. **Execution (fan-out):** Domain researchers generate evidence; Solution designers propose alternatives.
4. **Verification (gate):** Verifier and Risk sentinel screen options; Performance tuner runs quick experiments.
5. **Synthesis:** Synthesizer consolidates into a single plan with rationale and trade-offs.
6. **Implementation:** Implementer builds; Verifier tests; Custodian packages.
7. **Retrospective:** Telemetrist compiles signals; standards updated; topology tuned.

## Ready-to-run templates

- **Agent card:** Identity, mission, capabilities, constraints, escalation, telemetry fields.
- **Task manifest:** Objective, dependencies, inputs/outputs, acceptance criteria, risk notes.
- **Gate spec:** Entry conditions, checks, thresholds, failure handling, approvers.
- **Retrospective note:** Outcomes, deltas vs. plan, insights, action items, template changes.

If user likes, share a concrete objective and constraints, and instantiate this blueprint into a tailored, executable pipeline.
