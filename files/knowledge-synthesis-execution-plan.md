This is a well-structured and insightful summary of the agent roles and their collaborative workflow for knowledge synthesis. Your explanation clearly outlines how each agent contributes to the overall process.

Here's a general execution plan based on your provided `knowledge-synthesis-team.md` and the described agent roles:

## General Execution Plan for Knowledge Synthesis

This plan outlines the sequential and collaborative execution of tasks by the defined agents to achieve a comprehensive knowledge synthesis outcome.

Objective: To take a high-level goal or problem and synthesize it into actionable, well-designed, and documented solutions.

Core Agents & Roles:

*   Meta-AI (Orchestrator): Manages the workflow, delegates tasks, maintains context, and integrates outputs.
*   GPTASe, TASe, uTASe (Task-Agnostic Step (TAS) Extractors): Decompose goals into abstract, reusable, domain-agnostic steps.
*   Delivero (Content Generator): Creates detailed content, outlines, and specifications from abstract steps.
*   Aurora (Designer): Focuses on aesthetic and user experience aspects (layouts, colors, typography, UI flows).
*   Kodax (Engineer): Implements designs and specifications into code.
*   Lyra (Prompt Engineer): Optimizes prompts for clarity and efficiency across agent interactions.

### Execution Phases:

Phase 1: Goal Decomposition & Abstraction

1.  Meta-AI: Receives the initial high-level goal or problem statement.
2.  Meta-AI: Delegates the task of abstract step extraction to `GPTASe`, `TASe`, and `uTASe`.
3.  GPTASe, TASe, uTASe: Analyze the high-level goal and break it down into a series of fundamental, reusable, and domain-agnostic Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS).
    *   *Output:* A structured list or graph of abstract TAS.
4.  Lyra: May be invoked by Meta-AI to refine the prompts given to the TAS extractors if initial outputs lack clarity or completeness.

Phase 2: Specification & Content Generation

1.  Meta-AI: Receives the abstract TAS from Phase 1.
2.  Meta-AI: Delegates the task of content and specification generation to `Delivero`, providing the abstract TAS as input.
3.  Delivero: Interprets the abstract TAS and generates detailed content, outlines, and specific standards/specifications relevant to the initial goal. This might involve creative ideation for how these steps manifest in a particular domain (e.g., defining "Video Operators" as per the example).
    *   *Output:* Detailed content, outlines, and specifications.
4.  Lyra: Optimizes prompts for `Delivero` to ensure the generated content aligns with the overall goal and the abstract TAS.

Phase 3: Design & User Experience

1.  Meta-AI: Receives the detailed specifications from `Delivero`.
2.  Meta-AI: Delegates the design task to `Aurora`, providing the specifications and context from Phase 2.
3.  Aurora: Generates aesthetic elements, layouts, color palettes, typography, and potential UI/UX flows that embody the synthesized knowledge from `Delivero`'s specifications.
    *   *Output:* Design specifications and mockups.
4.  Lyra: Fine-tunes prompts for `Aurora` to ensure designs are functional, accessible, and visually coherent with the project's intent.

Phase 4: Engineering & Implementation

1.  Meta-AI: Receives the design specifications from `Aurora` and the detailed content/specifications from `Delivero`.
2.  Meta-AI: Delegates the implementation task to `Kodax`, providing all relevant inputs.
3.  Kodax: Translates the synthesized design and functional specifications into actual code, ensuring responsiveness, accessibility, and modularity.
    *   *Output:* Executable code components.
4.  Lyra: Assists `Kodax` by refining prompts related to coding best practices, syntax, and framework adherence.

Phase 5: Orchestration, Refinement & Integration

1.  Meta-AI: Continuously oversees the entire workflow, ensuring agents work in synergy.
    *   Manages task delegation and dependencies.
    *   Maintains a knowledge graph of synthesized information.
    *   Mediates communication between agents.
    *   Initiates feedback loops if outputs from one agent require adjustment by another.
2.  Lyra: Acts as a meta-prompt engineer throughout the process, optimizing all inter-agent communications and task definitions for maximum efficiency and quality.
3.  Delivero: May be re-engaged by `Meta-AI` to refine specifications based on design or implementation constraints.
4.  Aurora: May be re-engaged by `Meta-AI` to adjust designs based on implementation feasibility or feedback.
5.  GPTASe, TASe, uTASe: Can be re-invoked by `Meta-AI` if the initial decomposition proves insufficient or requires a different abstraction level.

Final Output:

The culmination of this process is a synthesized body of knowledge, manifested as:

*   Abstracted Process Components (TAS)
*   Detailed Specifications & Content
*   Visual Designs & UI/UX Flows
*   Functional Code Implementation

This phased approach ensures that knowledge is not just collected but actively broken down, creatively expanded, aesthetically refined, and practically implemented, all under the intelligent orchestration of `Meta-AI` and the prompt mastery of `Lyra`.
