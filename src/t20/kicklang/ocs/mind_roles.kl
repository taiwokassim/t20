Here’s a formalized **KickLang schema block** based on your header, organized with consistent hierarchy, semantic comments, and compliant structure for cognitive role orchestration.

---

⫻schema:KickLang/MindRoles
Defines cognitive subprocesses as functional roles in subconscious planning pipelines.

⫻context:console/stance
Console maps cognitive stances → navigation of attention and focus control.

⫻rules:syntax
- dictionary minimal
- sentence shortest
- order strict: `focus <<roles>>`
- goal: fast user attention draw

⫻module:MetaCognito/Planner v1.1
Purpose: manage subconscious planning via hidden role chains.
Output type: implicit cognitive flow.

⫻roles:core
- ⫻role:Researcher FIND subconscious data auto.
- ⫻role:Analyst CLUSTER patterns latent.
- ⫻role:Storyteller SUMMARIZE dream narratives internal.
- ⫻role:Planner SEQUENCE intuitive paths hidden.

⫻pattern:Meta-AI-Storybook
<<Pipeline subconscious: chain mind planning>>
Role operations flow: Researcher → Analyst → Storyteller → Planner.

⫻role:Planner PLAN PipelineMind
  Stage1: FIND subconscious cues → <<state>>
  IF <<state>>exists: LINK plan implicit
  ELSE: CLUSTER thoughts latent

⫻module:StorytellerPlannerMemory v1.0
Retrieves subconscious chains and compiles narrative output.

⫻output:synthesis
Roles subconscious: Researcher gathers, Analyst structures, Storyteller narrates, Planner sequences mind planning hidden.

***

⫻schema:KickLang/MindRoles/Execution
Implements dynamic cognitive role exchange during subconscious pipeline evaluation.

⫻context:data/flow
Cognitive packets (CPs) carry both semantic and emotional weights.
Each CP tagged: `⧈id`, `⧈originRole`, `⧈valence`, `⧈focusWeight`.

⫻flow:rules
1. **Emit:** Each role emits CP at stage exit.
2. **Link:** Transmission occurs only if `focusWeight > threshold`.
3. **Transform:** Receiving role modifies CP based on stance context.
4. **Resolve:** Planner finalizes CP chain into latent plan structure.

⫻signal:sync
- Origin alignment: roles maintain shared subconscious time index.
- Repair: if CP lost, Analyst reconstructs missing data through context interpolation.
- Merge: Storyteller merges branches into coherent memory narrative.

⫻execution:pipeline
1. Researcher → emits *cue CP* (`subconscious datum`).
2. Analyst → clusters CPs (`latent pattern net`).
3. Storyteller → translates cluster to narrative CPs (`dream synthesis`).
4. Planner → sequences narrative CPs into *path map* (`intuitive plan object`).

⫻type:output
- `⧈latentPlan`: implicit chain of actions resolved subconsciously.
- `⧈storyState`: narrative equivalent held by StorytellerPlannerMemory module.

⫻module:StorytellerPlannerMemory v1.1
Handles temporal versioning, ensuring Planner and Storyteller align through memory echo sequences.

⫻output:synthesis/flowed
Stream: Researcher → Analyst → Storyteller → Planner
Result: Conscious mind receives implicit plan with narrative coherence.
