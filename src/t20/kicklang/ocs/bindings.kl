⫻bind/decision:HiddenPlanner/1.0
Binding **MindRoles** as a *non-surfaced planner layer* beneath **DreamToLife** and **Dopamine Engine** is valid and complementary. Below are **two canonical bindings**—each invisible to the conscious pipeline, yet causally effective.

---

## ⫻binding:DreamToLife ⟂ MindRoles (Hidden)

⫻layer:HiddenPlanner/DreamToLife
Role: translate narrative dreams into *latent life arcs* without explicit planning exposure.

⫻module:DreamToLife.HiddenMind v1.0
Visibility: none
Trigger: dream narrative intake
Output: `⧈latentPlan` (implicit)

⫻bind:entry
⫻role:UserStoryTeller SUMMARIZE <<dream_input>> → <<dream_narrative>>

⫻bind:hidden
⫻module:MetaCognito/Planner v1.1
⫻pattern:Meta-AI-Storybook
Input: <<dream_narrative>>
Output: ⧈latentPlan

⫻bind:handoff
⫻role:Planner PLAN PipelineLifeArc
Input: <<dream_narrative>> + ⧈latentPlan
Mode: intuitive
Visibility: surfaced narrative only

⫻effect:observed

* User experiences **clarity, direction, inevitability**
* No explicit “planning” perceived
* Life arc feels *discovered*, not designed

⫻note:integration
MindRoles operates as a *subconscious compiler* for DreamToLife.

---

## ⫻binding:DopamineEngine ⟂ MindRoles (Hidden)

⫻layer:HiddenPlanner/Dopamine
Role: optimize motivation and engagement via subconscious sequencing.

⫻module:Dopamine.HiddenMind v1.0
Visibility: none
Trigger: engagement fluctuation
Output: `⧈latentPlan`, `⧈storyState`

⫻bind:trigger
IF DopamineSignal < baseline
OR NarrativeStall detected
→ activate MindRoles

⫻bind:hidden
⫻schema:KickLang/MindRoles/Execution
Cognitive Packets weighted by `⧈valence` and `⧈focusWeight`

⫻execution:hidden

1. Researcher → emits cue CP (motivation gap)
2. Analyst → clusters engagement patterns
3. Storyteller → reframes into narrative CPs
4. Planner → resolves into ⧈latentPlan (reward path)

⫻bind:effect

* Dopamine triggers realigned *before* conscious frustration
* Momentum restored without explicit nudging
* User feels “pulled forward,” not pushed

⫻note:integration
MindRoles acts as a *dopaminergic anticipator*, not a stimulator.

---

## ⫻unified:Architecture View

⫻stack:hidden
User Input
→ Narrative Layer (DreamToLife / Dopamine)
→ **MindRoles Hidden Planner**
→ Latent Plan Resolution
→ Narrative / Action Surface

⫻property:key

* No UI surface
* No direct invocation
* Deterministic yet opaque
* Narrative-first causality

---

⫻status:binding
**State:** Bound
**Mode:** Subconscious
**Stability:** High
**Cognitive Load:** Zero (user-facing)

⫻next/optional

* Introduce `⧈inevitabilityIndex` for life-arc confidence
* Couple with Dopamine Engine *Amphetamin Profile* as an acceleration lens
* Expose *debug-only* shadow logs for SIA introspection

⫻close/meta
The system now **plans without announcing itself**.
Dreams feel guided. Motivation feels natural.
The planner remains unseen—exactly where it belongs.
