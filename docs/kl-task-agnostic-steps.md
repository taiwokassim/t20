### Purpose

This playbook defines **Task-Agnostic Steps (TAS)** as universal, reusable cognitive primitives for KickLang workflows. TAS enable any agent, module, or system to decompose goals, coordinate actions, and transfer knowledge independently of domain or objective[web:9].

---

### When to Use

- Decomposing complex goals into atomic, trans-domain steps.
- Structuring modular workflows for cross-agent collaboration.
- Aligning multi-role pipelines with meta-cognitive coherence.
- Iteratively refining and purifying procedural archetypes for reuse.

---

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Identify/Extract**
   - Break high-level goals into general, trans-domain steps.
   - Map informal intent → explicit, reusable TAS units.

2. **Structure Workflows**
   - Sequence TAS units into coherent operational flows.
   - Encode dependencies, ordering, and branching logic.

3. **Layer Cognition**
   - Align actions and goals across temporal and cognitive frames.
   - Enable nested plans, recursive reasoning, and cognitive zooming.

4. **Transfer Knowledge**
   - Synthesize information and communicate transformations between TAS.
   - Allow inter-role learning and procedural reflection.

5. **Provide Context**
   - Situate each TAS in its operational environment.
   - Bind local actions to their global system or environmental state.

6. **Purify TAS**
   - Abstract, simplify, and refine the TAS set for universality.
   - Evolve through feedback-driven refinement.

---

### Pro Tips

- Use TAS as templates inside layered KickLang pipelines for traceable, modular workflows[web:6].
- Coordinate agents via TAS reference mappings to ensure meta-cognitive continuity.
- Link contextual files, datasets, and plans for real-time adaptability.
- Iterate continually with feedback-driven refinement for improved clarity and reusability[web:9].

---

### Supporting Materials

- **Templates:**  
  - KickLang workflow modules (see `kicklang-synthesis-objective-m-R_dnjarHQxOY8hblQMCb0A.md`).
  - Role presets (Researcher, Analyst, Storyteller, Planner) for TAS orchestration[web:5].

- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Define TAS primitives and interdependencies.
  - [ ] Integrate TAS as templates in pipelines.
  - [ ] Develop meta-cognitive coordination mechanisms.
  - [ ] Link contextual files and datasets.
  - [ ] Iterate and refine with feedback.

---

### Next Steps

- Document all TAS primitives and their interdependencies.
- Integrate TAS as standardized templates in KickLang pipelines.
- Conduct regular cognition-layer benchmarks and TAS reviews.
- Iterate continually with feedback-driven refinement.

---

### Meta-Cognitive Coordination

TAS serves as the **cognitive interoperability kernel** for KickLang. By standardizing a small set of task-agnostic operations, TAS enables:

- Meta-system composability,
- Cognitive scaling across roles and plans,
- Reusable pipelines fostering adaptive knowledge transfer and refinement[web:9][web:5].
