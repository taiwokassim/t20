# KickLang Syntax Reference

KickLang is a formal language and cognitive framework designed for orchestrating layered, role-based reasoning and knowledge structuring, with a syntax built around meta-communicative and modular workflows for dynamic collaboration in knowledge graphs. Below is a concise KickLang syntax reference based on the available documentation.[^2][^9]

### Core Role Presets

KickLang uses cognitive roles as lenses for system engagement. Common roles include:

- Researcher: Evidence gathering, source validation
- Analyst: Causal reasoning, trend mapping
- Storyteller: Narrative synthesis, context weaving
- Summarizer: Condensation into digestible insights
- Planner: Sequencing, dependencies, meta-logic

Each role can be parameterized for depth, focus, or output style.[^3][^9]

### Action Verb Catalog

KickLang’s syntax centers on verbs for knowledge access, structuring, and transformation:

- Knowledge Access: `FINDEntityRelation`, `LISTEntitiesRelations`, `DETAILEntity`
- Knowledge Structuring: `LINKEntityA, Relation, EntityB`, `MAPEntityA - EntityB`, `CLUSTEREntitySet`
- Knowledge Transformation: `SUMMARIZEEntityCorpus`, `COMPAREEntityA, EntityB`, `EXPLAINEntityRelation`
- Meta Operations: `COMMENT`, `PLANPipeline`, `TRANSFORMView`.[^3]


### Pipeline and Staging Syntax

Pipelines are defined with `PLANPipelineName` and can be staged for progressive knowledge building:

```
rolePlanner PLAN PipelineStorySegment StageCollectRequest, StageWeavePlot, StageUpdateWorld, StageNarrate, StageSyncCharacters, StageSynthesizeOutput
```

Stages can be conditional and support nested `PLAN` blocks for layered cognition.[^4][^9]

### Placebo Pipes and Meta-Markers

Placebo pipes are meta-markers for deferred or conditional steps:

- Example: `Planner PLAN PipelineClimateMitigationAnalysis StageCollectData, StageRunScenarioModels, StageDraftPolicyBrief`
Pipes signal staged actions or deferred logic, making all reasoning traceable.[^9][^3]


### Example Syntax Block

```
rolePlanner PLAN PipelineMain GranularityFine
  Stage1Prep FIND EntityContext context
  Stage2Nested roleSubPlanner PLAN PipelineSub context
  Stage3Synth SUMMARIZE PipelineSub output
```

This structure demonstrates role delegation, pipeline nesting, and compositional cognition.[^4][^9]

### Key Features

- Modular, reusable patterns and pipelines
- Role chaining for multi-perspective outputs
- Conditional branching and cognitive zooming
- Traceable, hierarchical reasoning through nested PLANs

KickLang’s syntax is designed for transparency, traceability, and cognitive orchestration, supporting both simple queries and complex, layered workflows.[^9][^3][^4]
